You have been selected to participate in the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation (New Mexico AMP), Undergraduate Research Scholars (URS) program for the Spring 2017 semester.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You will need to attend the following meeting on Wednesday February 1, 2017 at 12:00 - 1:00pm PM. The meeting will be held in Engineering Complex I (EC-3), Rm. 301. At the meeting I will provide a semester schedule of events and deliverables.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A general description of the URS program requirements follows; please be sure to read it carefully:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The URS program for the Spring semester runs from January 18th to May 14th. A spring semester work schedule of 10 or more hours per week devoted to your research is generally required to successfully complete your project.&nbsp;<strong>Please discuss your work plan and schedule with your research mentor as soon as possible, and be sure that you clearly understand what is expected of you.</strong>&nbsp;When negotiating your work schedule, please remember that there are other required activities of the URS program. Your participation is mandatory! Poor performance or lack of participation could result in loss of your cohort status and a reduced stipend for the current semester and suspension of further funding from New Mexico AMP.</li>
	<br />
	<li>Program components include workshops and meetings, an individual conference, a Goal Review Report, and preparation of a formal abstract and personal statement. Details and deadlines are described below:
	<ul><br />
		<li>Returning URSs will present their research from the fall at the URCAS conference on April 28th. All URS students must be registered for conference by March 25th. New URSs are required to attend the URCAS Conference.</li>
		<br />
		<li>You are required to participate in all workshops/meetings and one (1) individual conference. In addition, new URSs are required to attend an additional workshop on preparing a poster presentation (date to be determined).&nbsp;<em>This workshop will result in an initial draft of a research poster presentation and will help you to be fully prepared to present your research for the first time in the fall semester.</em></li>
		<br />
		<li>The<ins>&nbsp;Mid-Term Review</ins>&nbsp;will be due approximately on March 17th.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The<ins>&nbsp;formal abstract and personal statement</ins>&nbsp;will be due approximately around March 8th. These will be posted on the NM AMP website along with your photo.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Copies of poster presentations (new and returning URSs) are due at the end of the fall semester. These are to be printed in &quot;scale to fit paper&quot; format in PowerPoint.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In return for your participation in the URS program, you will receive a $2,000 stipend, which will be paid in two (2) equal installments: $1000 at the beginning of the spring semester and $1000 at the end of the semester, assuming that all requirements for the program have been met. Payments are processed through the NMSU Financial Aid Office, and all payments are subject to their approval.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In addition, your mentor is eligible to receive $250 for expendable research supplies related to your project. Eligible supplies expenditures are described in the New Mexico AMP Supplies Allowance Guidelines. If you are a new URS you will receive a copy of the guidelines at your first meeting.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Once again, congratulations and good luck to you this semester! We look forward to your successful participation in the New Mexico AMP Undergraduate Research Scholars program.&nbsp;<br />

Sincerely,&nbsp;<br />
