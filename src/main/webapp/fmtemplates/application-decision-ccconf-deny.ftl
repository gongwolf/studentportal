Unfortunately, we are unable at this time to offer you a New Mexico AMP URS position.<br />
<br />
Each semester we receive numerous applications for this scholarship. Due to the constraints of our National Science Foundation grant funding, we are unable to offer a scholarship to every applicant.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your interest in the New Mexico AMP program. We wish you all the best for the Spring 2017 semester. If you have any questions, please contact me at (575) 646-3211 or mgonzale@nmsu.edu.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Ester Gonzalez<br />
Program Specialist<br />
Engineering Complex I, Room 109</p>
